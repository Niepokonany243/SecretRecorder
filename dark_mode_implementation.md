# Dark Mode Implementation Plan

## Analysis
After analyzing the codebase, I found that:
- The app previously had dark mode functionality that was removed
- The app uses Material3 theming in Compose UI
- The app uses XML layouts with Material Design components
- The app has a settings manager (`AppSettingsManager`) for user preferences

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Create Dark Mode Resources
- [ ] Create a `values-night` directory with dark theme resources
- [ ] Create dark theme colors in `colors.xml` in the night directory
- [ ] Update `Theme.kt` to support both light and dark themes in Compose UI

### 2. Add Dark Mode Settings
- [ ] Update `AppSettingsManager.kt` to add theme preference methods
- [ ] Update `SettingsActivity.kt` to add theme selection UI
- [ ] Update `activity_settings.xml` to add theme selection controls
- [ ] Update `strings.xml` to add theme-related strings

### 3. Implement Theme Switching
- [ ] Update `SecretRecorderApplication.kt` to apply the selected theme
- [ ] Update activities to respect the theme setting
- [ ] Add theme toggle functionality

### 4. Test and Refine
- [ ] Test the app in both light and dark modes
- [ ] Ensure all UI elements adapt properly to theme changes
- [ ] Fix any visual inconsistencies

## Progress

- [ ] Ensure all UI elements adapt properly to theme changes
- [ ] Fix any visual inconsistencies

## Issues and Solutions

### Compilation Error in Theme.kt
We encountered a compilation error in the Theme.kt file related to dynamic color schemes and Compose libraries compatibility. To fix this issue, we simplified the Theme.kt implementation by:

1. Removing the dynamic color scheme functionality
2. Simplifying the theme implementation to just use light and dark color schemes
3. Removing the status bar color customization that was causing issues
4. Simplifying the Color.kt file to use basic color definitions

These changes should allow the app to compile and run properly while still providing dark mode functionality.

### Color Naming and Value Improvements
We improved the color naming and values in the app by:

1. Replacing generic "Purple" and "Pink" color names with more descriptive and appropriate names like "PrimaryLight", "SecondaryDark", etc.
2. Using color names that better reflect the actual colors used in the app (teal, slate, navy)
3. Ensuring the dark mode colors are visually pleasing and appropriate for a dark theme
4. Maintaining a consistent color scheme between light and dark modes
5. Updating the legacy purple color values to use our teal/blue color scheme for backward compatibility
6. Updating the app launcher icon background to use our teal color instead of green
7. Ensuring the recording indicator uses our error color instead of a purple-based color
8. Making sure all UI elements use our theme colors instead of hard-coded purple values

### Material Design Theme Overlay
To completely remove all purple colors from Material Design components, we created a custom Material Design theme overlay:

1. Created `material_theme_overlay.xml` files for both light and dark modes
2. Defined custom styles for Material Design components (buttons, FABs, cards, chips, sliders)
3. Applied the theme overlay to all themes in the app (Theme.SecretRecorder, AppTheme)
4. Overrode default Material Design colors with our teal/blue color scheme
5. Customized component-specific colors to ensure no purple colors appear anywhere in the app

### UI Improvements for Better Visibility
We made several UI improvements to enhance visibility and fix remaining purple elements:

1. Updated the recording timer text color to white for better visibility in dark mode
2. Changed the video duration text color to white in both the video gallery and recordings browser for better visibility
3. Enhanced the recording button icon with a white circle inside the red circle for a cooler, more intuitive design
4. Disabled tinting on the FloatingActionButton to prevent the purple tint from being applied
5. Updated the stop icon to use a hardcoded red color to ensure consistency
6. Ensured all text elements have appropriate contrast in both light and dark modes
