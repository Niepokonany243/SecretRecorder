# Audio Player Implementation Progress

## Analysis
- The app currently records both video and audio files
- Audio files are saved with .m4a extension
- Currently, audio files are played using external apps via Intent.ACTION_VIEW
- The app has a RecordingFile class that handles both audio and video files
- The app already has some audio-related icons and resources

## Implementation Plan
1. Create AudioPlayerActivity
2. Create layout for audio player
3. Update RecordingsBrowserActivity to use built-in player
4. Update AndroidManifest.xml
5. Add any additional resources needed

## Progress

- [x] Implementation complete

## Implementation Details

### 1. Created AudioPlayerActivity
Implemented a dedicated activity for playing audio files with the following features:
- Media playback using Android's MediaPlayer
- Play/pause functionality
- Seek forward/backward by 10 seconds
- Progress tracking with a seek bar
- Time display (current position and total duration)
- Basic audio file information display

### 2. Created Layout for Audio Player
Designed a user-friendly audio player UI with:
- Top bar with back button and title
- Audio visualization area (with placeholder for future waveform visualization)
- Playback controls (play/pause, rewind, forward)
- Seek bar for navigation
- Time display
- Audio details section

### 3. Updated RecordingsBrowserActivity
Modified the `playRecording` method to:
- Continue using external player for video files
- Use our built-in AudioPlayerActivity for audio files

### 4. Added Resources
- Added necessary icons (rewind, forward, pause)
- Added string resources for the audio player

### 5. Updated AndroidManifest.xml
- Registered the new AudioPlayerActivity

## Next Steps
- Test the implementation with real audio files
- Consider adding waveform visualization in the future
- Add more advanced audio controls if needed (equalizer, playback speed, etc.)
