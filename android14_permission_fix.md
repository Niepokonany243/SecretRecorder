# Android 14 Permission Fix

## Issue
The app is showing a toast message about camera and microphone permissions being required on Android 14, even though the user has already granted these permissions.

## Root Causes

1. **Permission Handling on Android 14**: Android 14 has stricter permission handling, especially for foreground services with camera and microphone access.

2. **Toast Message Display**: The app shows a toast message when permissions are denied, but doesn't properly handle the case where permissions are already granted on Android 14.

3. **Permission Check Logic**: The app may not be correctly checking for granted permissions on Android 14.

## Solution Approach

1. Update the permission handling to properly check for permissions on Android 14
2. Add better logging to understand why the app thinks permissions are not granted
3. Add a specific check for Android 14 permission handling
4. Ensure the app properly handles the case where permissions are already granted

## Implementation Steps

1. Update the `checkAndRequestPermissions()` method in MainActivity.kt
2. Add better logging for permission checks
3. Add specific handling for Android 14 permissions
4. Test the changes on Android 14 devices
