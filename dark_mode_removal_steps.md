# Dark Mode Removal Steps

## Analysis
I analyzed the codebase to identify all dark mode related code:
- Found dark mode references in styles.xml, themes.xml, and colors.xml
- Found an empty values-night directory
- Checked the progress file (dark_mode_removal_progress.md) to see what had already been done

## Actions Taken
1. **Updated styles.xml**
   - Changed `AppTheme` parent from `Theme.Material3.DayNight.NoActionBar` to `Theme.Material3.Light.NoActionBar`
   - Removed the `AppTheme.Dark` style completely
   - Removed dark-specific styles (Toolbar.Dark, Button.Dark, TextAppearance.Dark, ChipTextAppearance.Dark, etc.)

2. **Updated themes.xml**
   - Changed `FullScreenNoTitleTheme` parent from `Theme.MaterialComponents.DayNight.NoActionBar` to `Theme.MaterialComponents.Light.NoActionBar`

3. **Updated colors.xml**
   - Removed all dark theme colors

4. **Removed the empty values-night directory**
   - Used PowerShell to remove the directory

5. **Updated the progress file**
   - Added the additional changes made to the summary section

## Next Steps
- Run the app to test the changes
- Verify that the app always uses light mode regardless of system settings
