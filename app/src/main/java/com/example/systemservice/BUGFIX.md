# Secret Recorder App Bug Fix Report

## Issue Description
The app was experiencing a critical bug where recordings would restart from 00:00 whenever the user navigated away from the app or to a different section (like the recorded videos section). This resulted in recordings not being saved properly, causing data loss.

## Root Cause Analysis
After investigating the codebase, the following issues were identified:

1. **Improper Service Lifecycle Management**:
   - The app was clearing recording sessions in multiple places, including when the app was resumed or when navigating between screens.
   - The `SecretRecorderApplication.kt` was clearing shared preferences at application start, which disrupted ongoing recordings.
   - The `RecordingWorker` was also clearing recording sessions, interfering with the recording process.

2. **Inconsistent Recording State Management**:
   - The app was storing recording state in SharedPreferences, but these preferences were being cleared inappropriately.
   - Multiple components were trying to manage the recording state, leading to conflicts.

3. **Lacks Proper Communication Between Components**:
   - The app components weren't properly communicating recording state changes.
   - UI updates were not properly synchronized with the actual recording service state.

## Changes Made

### 1. SecretRecorderService.kt
- Completely rewrote the service to properly manage recording lifecycle
- Added explicit ACTION constants for starting and stopping recordings
- Added broadcast actions to communicate service state to other components
- Improved file handling and error management
- Removed inappropriate SharedPreferences clearing
- Ensured recordings are properly finalized and saved
- Improved notification handling

### 2. MainActivity.kt
- Updated to use the new service APIs with explicit actions
- Added broadcast receivers to listen for service state changes
- Improved service state detection using direct checks rather than SharedPreferences
- Fixed UI updating logic to ensure it accurately reflects the recording state
- Removed code that was clearing SharedPreferences inappropriately

### 3. SecretRecorderApplication.kt
- Removed code that was clearing recording sessions at application start
- Renamed and refocused the worker to handle storage management only
- Eliminated any code that could interfere with recordings

### 4. RecordingWorker.kt
- Refocused it to solely handle storage management without interfering with recordings
- Removed any code that was clearing recording sessions
- Added proper cleanup capabilities
- Scheduled to run less frequently (once per day) to reduce interference

## Testing Results
After implementing these changes, the app now:
1. Correctly maintains recording state when navigating between screens
2. Properly saves recordings when completed
3. Shows accurate recording time without resetting to 00:00
4. Handles service lifecycle appropriately without disrupting ongoing recordings

## Additional Recommendations
For further improvement:
1. Implement a more robust error handling system
2. Add comprehensive logging for better debugging
3. Consider using a more modern approach like MVVM architecture with StateFlow for state management
4. Add automated tests to verify recording functionality
5. Use a dependency injection framework like Hilt to better manage component dependencies
