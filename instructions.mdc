     - Resolution (width Ã— height)
     - Frame rate (FPS)
     - Estimated bitrate
     - Video codec
     - File size
   - Added toggle button to show/hide details panel
   - Implemented metadata extraction from MediaMetadataRetriever to display accurate information

4. **Improved Empty State UI**
   - Removed the "Start Recording" button from the empty state view
   - Updated guidance text to direct users to return to the main screen for recording

5. **Modernized UI Interactions**
   - Replaced outdated list selectors with modern ripple effects
   - Enhanced video controls with seek bar and proper playback time display
   - Added proper playback state management
   - Implemented consistent styling matching the dark theme
