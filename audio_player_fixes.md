# Audio Player Implementation Fixes

## Issues Encountered

There were compilation errors in the AudioPlayerActivity.kt file:

1. Line 135: `Val cannot be reassigned` - This was because we were trying to reassign a value to the `duration` variable.
2. Line 147: `Val cannot be reassigned` - Similar issue with the `isPlaying` variable.

## Fixes Applied

1. Changed the code to use a local variable `audioDuration` to store the media player's duration, then assign it to the class-level `duration` variable.
2. Recreated the AudioPlayerActivity.kt file to ensure all variables were properly declared as `var` instead of `val`.
3. Removed unnecessary imports.

## Current Status

The implementation is complete and the build should now succeed. The audio player is ready for testing.

## Next Steps

1. Test the implementation with real audio files.
2. Consider adding waveform visualization in the future.
3. Add more advanced audio controls if needed (equalizer, playback speed, etc.).
