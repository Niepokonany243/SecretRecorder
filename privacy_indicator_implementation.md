# Privacy Indicator Feature Implementation

## Requirements
- Detect when recording starts (camera or microphone)
- For Android 12+ devices, show a dialog about privacy indicators
- Offer two options:
  1. Disable the indicator using LADB command
  2. Use a SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW overlay to cover the indicator
- Include "Don't show again" checkbox
- Store preference in SharedPreferences
- Work in background recording flow

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Create PrivacyIndicatorManager

### 3. Create Dialog and Overlay Layouts
- Create layout for the privacy indicator dialog
- Create layout for the small overlay that covers the indicator

### 4. Modify AppSettingsManager
- Add methods to store privacy indicator preferences
- Add "don't show again" preference

### 5. Modify MainActivity and SecretRecorderService
- Add code to detect recording start
- Show the dialog when recording starts on Android 12+
- Handle user choices from the dialog

### 6. Update AndroidManifest

## Implementation Summary

We have successfully implemented a feature that detects when recording starts (camera or microphone) and shows a privacy indicator dialog for Android 12+ devices. The implementation includes:

1. A privacy indicator dialog that informs users about Android's privacy indicators (green/orange dots)
2. Improved ADB instructions with:
   - Clear explanation of how to disable the indicator
   - Command displayed in a code-style box
   - Copy button for easy copying of the command
3. A "Don't show again" checkbox to suppress the dialog in future sessions
4. Storage of user preferences in SharedPreferences

The feature works in the foreground recording flow, and it's only activated on Android 12+ devices. We removed the overlay option as requested and focused on making the ADB instructions more user-friendly.
